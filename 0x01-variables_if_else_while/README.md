Positive anything is better than negative nothing
The last digit
I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I cant fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
 a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line
a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line
a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.
a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.
